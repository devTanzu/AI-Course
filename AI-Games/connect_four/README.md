## GameplayÂ Overview
- **Board:** 2â€‘D list representing a 6â€¯Ã—â€¯7 grid.  
- **Turns:** Players alternate selecting a column (0â€¯â€“â€¯6).  
- **Checks performed after each move:**  
  1. Fourâ€‘inâ€‘aâ€‘row, in any direction.

## Features
- Interactive terminal interface with clear prompts.  
- Realâ€‘time board rendering using ASCII characters.  
- Robust win & draw detection.  
- Clean, wellâ€‘commented source codeâ€”great for learning 2â€‘D array manipulation and basic game logic.
